    # Literate Programming in C#

    Produce good-looking, interactive documentation for your C# projects using
    [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). 
    Write comments in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and 
    create fully functional web sites that can be published on 
    [GitHub](https://github.com) or other web hosting services.

## Fully Customizable Output

Generate either raw markdown files or static web sites with everything included. 
Use themes and parameters to customize the sites. You can include a 
[YAML](http://yaml.org/) front matter in your source files to pass parameters to 
themes.

[Markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig)
library is used to convert the markdown to HTML. It enables a lot of useful
extensions from [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) formulas to 
[mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/) diagrams.

## Interactive Code Blocks

The tool uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) to parse and analyze
source code. Syntactic and semantic information provided by Roslyn is used for 
syntax-highlighting and for adding cross-references and type information in
code snippets. You can jump to the definition of a symbol by clicking it, or 
inspect its type by hovering over it.

## Easy Navigation

Navigation panes are added automatically to help find a specific topic. Table 
of Contents file outlines the structure of the documentation. TOC file can be 
automatically generated and updated. The outputted web pages will show the TOC
in a sidebar as well as navigation buttons that jump to the previous and next
section.
